# Bedtime Fan

Here's a quick mock prototype of a Bedtime Fan app for Slumber.

I love to create mockup apps with SwiftUI, it is so much fun, so when I saw the design screenshot on Slumber's website, I could, I just couldn't pass it up! After doing the initial coding, which took me about 2 hours, I started with adding the real functionality (simple scrolling, toggles, buttons).

I plan to add sounds, music, and animations during the following days. I hope to have a working prototype in a week or so, and show it to the Slumber's recruiting team. It just could be that they'd want someone who has already done the first step in actually building their app.

Here are a couple of screens:
